	<h2>Testing a sequence of actions on a System</h2>

	Let's walk through a simple example of a test using a flow style
	interpreter.

	<div>
		<p>First, we need to import the package containing the fixture
			code for our banking application.</p>
		<table border="1" cellspacing="0">
			<tr>
				<td>import</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>info.novatec.testit.livingdoc.interpreter.flow.workflow</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
	</div>

	<div>
		<p>
			We want to execute a sequence of actions on the bank fixture. We'll
			use the
			<code>WorkflowInterpreter</code>
			for that.
		</p>

		<TABLE border="1" cellspacing="0">
			<TR>
				<td>Workflow</td>
				<td>Withdrawing money from account</td>
			</TR>
			<tr>
				<td>Given</td>
				<td>an interested customer</td>
				<td>Johnny Smith</td>
			</tr>
		</TABLE>

		<p>
			Our first business rule says that a new account should have a balance
			of 0.00 dollars. <br /> We will verify this rule with two actions.
			The first one opens and account and the second one checks its
			balance. The
			<code>check</code>
			keyword - in the first cell of the second row - indicates that we
			want to check the result of the action against the value specified in
			the last cell.
		</p>

		<table border="1" cellspacing="0">
			<tr>
				<td>When</td>
				<td>he opens a new checking account</td>
				<td>12345</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>check that</td>
				<td>the balance of account</td>
				<td>12345</td>
				<td>is</td>
				<td>$0</td>
			</tr>
			
		</table>

		<p>Savings account should follow the same rule. Let's verify that.
		</p>

		<table border="1" cellspacing="0">
			<tr>
				<td>When</td>
				<td>he opens a new savings account</td>
				<td>54321</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>check that</td>
				<td>the balance of account</td>
				<td>54321</td>
				<td>is</td>
				<td>$0</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>And not that</td>
				<td>an error occured</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
